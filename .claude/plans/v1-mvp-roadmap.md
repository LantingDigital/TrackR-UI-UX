# TrackR V1 MVP Roadmap

> **Created**: December 8, 2024
> **Status**: Active
> **Goal**: Build the home base for roller coaster enthusiasts

---

## Project Vision

TrackR is a premium mobile app for the roller coaster community. It's not just a logger—it's the place enthusiasts open every day for news, games, planning, and tracking.

### V1 MVP Scope

| Category | Features |
|----------|----------|
| **Core Logging** | Credit tracking, RCDB data, customizable rating system, seat/row logging |
| **Wallet/Scan** | Digital wallet for tickets/passes (Apple Wallet-style UX) |
| **Daily Engagement** | Mini-games (3-4 at launch), news feed with pinned parks |
| **Planning Utility** | Curated park guides (15-20 at launch) |
| **Shareability** | Stat cards for social media |
| **Milestones** | Credit count celebrations, "On This Day" memories |

### V1.1 (Post-MVP)
- Trip planner (single day and multi-day)

### Long-Term Backlog
- Spotify Wrapped-style year-end summary
- AI-powered features (ride comparison, forces profile)
- Community/social features
- Trading card game

## Navigation Structure

### 5-Tab Layout

```
Home | Discover | Play | Activity | Profile
```

| Tab | Purpose | Contains |
|-----|---------|----------|
| **Home** | Daily dashboard | News feed, pinned parks, "On This Day", action buttons (Log/Search/Scan morphs) |
| **Discover** | Encyclopedia | Browse parks, coasters, rankings, park guides |
| **Play** | Daily engagement | Mini-games (3-4 at launch) |
| **Activity** | Personal tracking | Pending ratings, recent logs (history), credit milestones |
| **Profile** | Settings & stats | Stats dashboard, shareable stat card, wallet management, settings, rating criteria |

### Key Distinction
- **Home** = Feed (passive consumption, what's new)
- **Discover** = Browse (active exploration, what exists)

---

## Architecture: Reusable Systems

### 1. Morph Animation System

Extract the hero morph pattern into reusable hooks/components:

```
src/
  hooks/
    useMorphAnimation.ts    # Shared animation values & handlers
    useSpringPress.ts       # Press-in/press-out spring feedback
  components/
    MorphableModal/
      MorphableModal.tsx    # Container with backdrop + morph logic
      MorphingPill.tsx      # The morphing element itself
```

**useMorphAnimation** provides:
- `morphProgress`, `backdropOpacity`, `contentFade`
- `openMorph()`, `closeMorph()`
- Interpolation helpers for position, size, borderRadius

This allows any screen to have the same polish without duplicating 500+ lines.

### 2. Spring Press Feedback

Currently duplicated everywhere. Extract:

```typescript
// useSpringPress.ts
const { scaleValue, pressHandlers } = useSpringPress({
  pressedScale: 0.97,
  springConfig: RESPONSIVE_SPRING,
});
```

### 3. Card Components

Standardize card patterns:

```
src/
  components/
    cards/
      BaseCard.tsx          # Shadow, border radius, press feedback
      ContentCard.tsx       # For content items (news, guides)
      ActionCard.tsx        # For tappable actions
      StatCard.tsx          # For stats display
```

### 4. Animation Constants

Centralize spring physics:

```typescript
// src/constants/animations.ts
export const SPRINGS = {
  responsive: { damping: 16, stiffness: 180, mass: 0.8 },
  bouncy: { damping: 14, stiffness: 120, mass: 1 },
  morph: { damping: 14, stiffness: 42, mass: 1.2 },
};

export const TIMING = {
  fast: 150,
  normal: 250,
  slow: 400,
};
```

## Success Metrics (V1)

- [ ] Can log a ride in < 10 seconds from Home
- [ ] Can rate a ride with full criteria
- [ ] Can scan a ticket and see it at the gate
- [ ] Can browse and read park guides
- [ ] Can play at least 3 mini-games
- [ ] Can see stats and share a stat card
- [ ] All animations run at 60fps
- [ ] No crashes in normal usage

---

## Notes

- **Animation Library**: Migrating from React Native Animated API to react-native-reanimated. Migration is in progress -- see `.claude/animation/migration-log.md`.
- **Data Source**: RCDB integration is critical. Start with static dataset, add sync later.
- **Monetization**: Free tier is generous. Pro tier ($29.99/year) unlocks advanced stats, shareable content, custom criteria weights, offline mode.
- **Park Guides**: User will write first 15-20. Community can comment. Paid users can submit for review.
